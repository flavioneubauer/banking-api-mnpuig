# Flavio Neubauer Task Log

1. after reading README file I started to set the basic requirements for the task:

1.1 Project using Java and Spring

Decided to create a Spring boot project using https://start.spring.io/. Selected Web, lombok, Data Jpa, Postgres, actuator and dev tools as dependencies.

Also selected jdk 17 for this project. 

After that, got a docker-compose with a simple postgres to spin up the database for testing and configured application.properties. 

Now, I just ran the application and checked the it is up and running. 

Also added a .gitignore to avoid commiting build files.
